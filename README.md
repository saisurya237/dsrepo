# Binary Tree Traversal and Lowest Common Ancestor

This project implements:
- In-order traversal of a binary tree.
- Finding the Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA) of two nodes:
  - Using a brute-force path-finding approach.
  - Using an optimized efficient DFS approach.

## Files

- `tree_traversal.py`: Contains the full implementation with comments and examples.
- `test_tree_traversal.py`: Contains unit tests for validation.

## How to Run

1. Ensure you have Python 3 installed.
2. Clone or download this repository.
3. Run the main tree_traversal file:

```bash
python tree_traversal.py
