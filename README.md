# Binary Tree Traversal and Lowest Common Ancestor

This project implements:
- In-order traversal of a binary tree.
- Finding the Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA) of two nodes:
  - Using a brute-force path-finding approach.
  - Using an optimized efficient DFS approach.

# Cycle Detection in Linked Lists

This project implements:
- Detection of a cycle in a singly linked list.
- Two methods:
  - **Brute-force approach** using a hash set.
  - **Optimized approach** using **Floyd's Tortoise and Hare Algorithm**.
